## AER303 Lab "Aerodynamic Forces on Airfoils"

This repository contains code and data for analyzing aerodynamic forces on a Clark Y airfoil in a low-speed wind tunnel, part of the AER303 Aerospace Laboratory I course.
The code includes tools for loading, analyzing, and reporting experimental data, with calculations for lift, drag, and moment coefficients across varying angles of attack.
